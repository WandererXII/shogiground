[lishogi.org](https://lishogi.org).
It targets modern browsers, as well as mobile development using Cordova.

## Features

![Shogiground](/screenshot/board2.png)

Shogiground is designed to fulfill all lishogi.org web and mobile apps needs, so it is pretty featureful.

- Well typed with TypeScript
- Fast. Uses a custom DOM diff algorithm to reduce DOM writes to the absolute minimum.
- Small footprint: cca 40K unzipped. No dependencies.
- SVG drawing of circles and arrows on the board and hands
- Individual square elements for styling
- Entirely configurable and reconfigurable at any time
- Styling with CSS only: board, pieces and drawn shapes can be changed by simply switching a class
- Fluid layout: board can be resized at any time
- Full mobile support (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- Move or drop pieces by click
- Move or drop pieces by drag & drop
  - Minimum distance before drag
  - Centralisation of the piece under the cursor
  - Piece ghost element
  - Drop off revert or trash
- Supports shogi-like promotions
- Premove or predrop by click or drag
- Animation of pieces: moving and fading away both on board and from hands
- Display last move, check, move destinations, and premove destinations (hover effects possible)
- Import and export positions in SFEN notation, custom sfen parser/renderer
- User callbacks
- Supports board dimensions up to 16x16
- No shogi logic inside: can be used for [shogi variants](https://lishogi.org/variant)

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save shogiground
```

### Usage

```js
import { Shogiground } from 'shogiground';

const config = {
  sfen: {
    board: 'lnsgkgsnl/1r5b1/ppppppppp/9/9/9/PPPPPPPPP/1B5R1/LNSGKGSNL',
  },
};
const ground = Shogiground(config, { board: document.body });
```

#### Non-module environments

Or you can simply pull the latest version from `jsdelivr`.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/shogiground@latest/dist/shogiground.min.js"></script>
```

#### CSS

To actually see and use the board you need some CSS. You can use the CSS in `examples/assets` as a starting point. But it will take some work to get it exactly how you want it.
